fig_notes <- "Notes: The results shown are based on a linear regression model that measures the effect of combined use of digital technology applications on consumer protection risks. This model includes controls for two variables: years of experience and educational attainment of the owner or manager of the firm. The regression parameters are used to compute predicted probabilities to show the marginal effect of digital technology adoption on productivity. The height of 'Baseline' corresponds to the predicted productivity for firms run by an owner with mean years of experience, and secondary-level educaitonal attainment."
